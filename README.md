# Business Site

Create a responsive site for a made up company with HTML & CSS and do it through mob-programming.

## The problem

One person created the project and shared it with everyone else through using VSCode and Live Share.
We then approached the assignment as a team, discussing our different options and how to move forwards.
There was some basic design discussion concerning fonts, colors and responsivity.
The actual coding was done through mob-programming during which was new to all of us.
Had we had more time we probably would've tried developing from a mobile first-standpoint.
